# Undergrad thesis GH Python scripts

This is a collection of some of the scripts used in my undergraduate thesis, including

- script used to inteface with EnergyPlus for the calculation of the behavior of difference Phase Change Materials.
- original (non-gui) script used to scrape data from wunderground and data cleaning scripts.

These scripts are meant to run inside Grasshopper, they will not work as standalone python scripts.
